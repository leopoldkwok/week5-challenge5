####**Challenge 5 - Rock, Paper and Scissors**
Create a rock, paper, scissors game that you can play in your browser.

####**Level 1**
Grab the code (https://github.com/makersacademy/rockpaperscissors) and create a sinatra based web application that you can play on your browser(you might, or might not, need to change the code ever so slightly*).

####**Level 2**
Deploy your application to Heroku. Have two separate deployment targets: staging and production, so you’ll have two apps on Heroku that you’ll be deploying to and three git remotes (origin, staging, production. More here: https://devcenter.heroku.com/articles/multiple-environments). Make sure your app works both in staging and production. The goal is to have two separate deployment targets running in the same environment and on the same platform. This way you can deploy to staging first and, if everything goes well, deploy to production later. This is a common devops technique (tip: google is your friend if you did not understand this) Play a round or two on both, staging and production.

####**Level 3**
After you have deployed it to heroku, add NewRelic add-on to the production environment on Heroku and find out the average page loading time using NewRelic's interface. Explore NewRelic to see what other analytical tools are available. Write a little about what can be done with NewRelic in your own words and understanding.

####**Bonus Level**
Yes, you guessed right. Make your application beautiful! It’s always nice to have an app that not only works nicely, but also looks good!
